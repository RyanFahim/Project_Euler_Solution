#The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

#12+22+...+102=385
#The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

#(1+2+...+10)2=552=3025
#Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640.

#Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum
